Lesson 6 - Placing Images On A Web Page Using CSS
==================================================

We can do the same thing for images as we have done for text.  This can be useful for borders, separators, logos, or any web page decoration or icon.

**Exercise: Place An Image On A Web Page Using JavaScript**

This can be used for apps, but also for simple games in which the images are not animated.

[TYPE](http://jsbin.com/kojisuwuwo/1/edit?html,output) in the following code and watch it work → 
```
<img id="myImg" src="">
<script type='text/javascript'>
function myFunction() {
    			document.getElementById("myImg").src = "http://goo.gl/WuZpA5";
}
</script>
```
Not working?  Did you forget to call the function at the end - myFunction(); 
← [SEE](http://jsbin.com/tuhayeqene/1/edit?html,output) the result

This could also be used to change an image - if a pre-existing image is there.

**Congratulations**

You now know the basics of how to use JavaScript with HTML.  With the extra knowledge from your Code Academy course you could probably create a simple app or text based game along with using what you have learnt in this tutorial.
